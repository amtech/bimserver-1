# BIMserver
_IFC modelserver version1.5_


### About
The Building Information Modelserver (short: BIMserver) enables you to store and manage the information of a construction (or other building related) project. Data are stored in the open standard IFC. The BIMserver is n√≥t a fileserver, but uses a model-driven architecture approach. This means that IFC data are stored in an underlying database. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility to query, merge and filter the BIM-model and generate IFC files on the fly.

### Instructions

See a full list of instructions on the wiki at https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki

### IMPORTANT

Due to the nature of the costs incurred to run a BIM server on a project, there is a half an hour limit on the time that each instance of a server you can create. After, at which point your app, your data - will be destroyed. Please be careful and understand that this is just so that I don't get a massive bill I cant afford. If you would like to run one in production, please contact me with interest: john@jenca.io
